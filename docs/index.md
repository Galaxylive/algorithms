# Documentation

The documentation sturcture of this project is that first I will explain what the algorithm or the data structure does, why it is important ... etc.

And than I will implement it in python to let the use see a code exmaple, I can use another lanuguage but to be fair python is one of the most readable languages out there. Plus you can see the other examples from their own source code.

## Data Structures

- [Stack](./stack.md)
