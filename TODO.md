## Basics:

- Apart from the list of algortihms and data structures to impelement down 
  below I will also make an app (probably it will be a directory) to meas-
  -ure the `time complexity` and `space complexity` of the given ds and a-
  -lgorithms. I will import the data strcutres and algos from the implemen
  -tations that I have made down below (dont forget to use notations such 
  as theta, omega, big O ... etc.):
