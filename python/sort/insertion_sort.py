    Def: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final
         sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient
         on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort,
         heapsort, or merge sort.

    Complexity: Best: n^2 | Average: n^2 | Worst: n^2
